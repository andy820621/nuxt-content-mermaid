title: Mindmap - creative weekend goals
type: mindmap
variant: personal-goals
tags:
  - mindmap
  - planning
config:
  mindmap:
    padding: 25
    maxNodeWidth: 140
    layoutAlgorithm: balanced
expect: Illustrates how to outline a creative weekend with drawing, writing, adventure, and rest branches.
notes:
  - Good for verifying multiple levels of nodes and the default radial layout behave well with varied node widths.
  - Leaves room to test node text wrapping via `maxNodeWidth`.
